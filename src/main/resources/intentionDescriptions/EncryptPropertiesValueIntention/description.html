<p>
Encrypt the selected property value using the dotenv.public.key defined in the properties file.
This intention is available in .properties files when the caret is on a property value that is not already encrypted
and the file contains a <code>dotenv.public.key</code> entry.
</p>
<p>
The value will be replaced with an encrypted form like <code>encrypted:...</code> so it can be committed safely.
