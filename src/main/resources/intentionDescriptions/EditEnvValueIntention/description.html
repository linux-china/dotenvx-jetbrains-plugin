    Edit the encrypted .env value using the DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY defined in the same file.
    This intention is available in .env files when the caret is on a value that is not already encrypted
    and the file contains a DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY entry.

<p>
    The value will be replaced with an encrypted form like <code>encrypted:...</code> so it can be committed safely.
