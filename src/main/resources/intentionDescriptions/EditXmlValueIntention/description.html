    Edit the encrypted XML text/attribute value using the dotenv.public.key defined in the same file.
    This intention is available in XML files when the caret is on a text/attribute value that is not already encrypted

    The value will be replaced with an encrypted form like <code>encrypted:...</code> so it can be committed safely.
